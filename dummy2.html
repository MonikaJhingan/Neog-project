I completed Btech in Electronics and Communications Engineering and did Job at HCL for 1 year and then I started teaching. I have a great interest in software development so I learnt python and trained students at Navgurukul but now I want to brush up my skills and learn Javascript and want to become a successful coder in my life and break the orthodox barriers. I also want to be an inspiration for other girls so that they can leave their comfort zones and take their own responsibilities and explore the opportunities around them and can become a "Bread Earner" for their family. 

        Python has captured the market since the past few years, I was quite enthused by its immensive presence among the market giants.
        The most interesting part is its very easy and and it has an extensive use in fields like Data science, Artificial Intelligence. I learnt C++ during myschool times and I am also familiar with C which I studied during my college times.
        
        So, its not important to know a alot of languages its about understanding the basic concepts so rather than Quantitative study we all should focus on "Qualitative study".
