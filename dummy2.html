       <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">Currently I am working with Navgurukul Foundation, I completed Btech in Electronics and Engineering and did Job at HCL for 1 year and then I started teaching. I have a great interest in software development so I learnt python and trained students at Navgurukul but now I want to brush up my skills and learn Javascript and want to become a succesful coder in my life and break paths.
